2) Lists, stacks, queues, hashing, priority queues
3) Binary search trees, Balanced binary search trees
4) Graphs, Depth-first search, Topological ordering
5) Breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm
6) Algorithms of Prim and Kruskal, Disjoint-set Union-Find problem

These folders contain most of my JAVA data array structures.

- Array Structures:

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List
Stack 
Queue
Binary Search Trees
Hash Tables

Promote use of polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and iterators.
